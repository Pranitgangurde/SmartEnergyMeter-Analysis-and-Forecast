# SmartEnergyMeter-Analysis-and-Forecast
This is a repository dedicated for a work we have done on Project named-'Energy usage Analysis and Forecast on London city'.
Once a Kaggle Competition; Smart Meters in London city is a data specially about time-series. In this project we try to analyze energy consumption patterns based on indicators like weather,socioeconomic condition of people and blocks they were living.
Here is link of Kaggle data of Smart Meters in London: https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london.
Here, one can find ACCORN Categories in data where people are classified into various accorn categories.
In this Jupyter Notebooks Me and My team try to explore various aspects of data using pandas,numpy and matplotlib libraries.
We apply feature selection and scaling of features so that outliers,undetected trends can be removed.
Later we done prediction on data,as this is time series data we have used popular SARIMAX, fbprophet algorithms to get predictions of
energy consumption. We also used LSTM-RNN for this time series data.
